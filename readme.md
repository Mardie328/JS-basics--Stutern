6. Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category

- Statically Typed programming languages are those that perform type checking at compile-time, meaning the type of a variable must be explicitly declared before the code is compiled. Examples are Java, C, C++ etc
- Dynamically Typed programming languages are those that perform type checking at runtime, meaning the type of a variable is determined by the value it is assigned at runtime. examples are JavaScript, Python, Ruby etc

7. Differentiate between the JavaScript data types ‘null’ and ‘undefined’
   'undefined' is a value that is automatically assigned to a variable that has been declared, but has not been assigned a value yet while 'null' is an intentional non-value, and can be explicitly assigned to a variable as a representation of no value.
